      " And that's recording again? Yes. Cool. Search for a roundtrip flight from Toronto, Singapore to Barniagate. Okay, so the same instructions by Elizabeth. One layover total time of three hours. Why does this smell so heezy so much? Um... I- this is annoying, I don't want that. I'm trying to search things. Um... What was annoying? There was a pop-up, like a little modal that showed up. I'm not good at this. Um... the first of the tenth is what I'm looking for. It says two adults, I'm gonna bring it down to one. Wait, I'm on Hotels Not Plates. Um, I am mentally taxed at the moment. Um, you've made me think too much. From Toronto to Singapore. Um... Singapore all airports. This one's design is better, it shows things hierarchically, which is really nice. Um, it's set to December for some reason? I don't know why. Um, first to tenth... Go... This is... Cheapest one, thirty hours one layover. Seems to take forever again. It said it's looking out for flexible ticket options, but I don't want those and that actually has me a little bit concerned. Um... I'm already gonna set it to cheapest. I'm gonna set it to one stop max. All airlines, I don't really care. We said twenty five hours. There's no points on this. So I can't tell... Where it's like, like... How many hours. Like, why is the maximum number of hours forty six hours? Um... Wait, we said thirty hours, not twenty five. For some reason I thought it was twenty five. I don't know why I thought that. Um... I see a list of things. I just want the cheapest one again. It has one stop. It's going from Toronto to Singapore. Um... It's hard to tell, I feel... So a lot of times there's ads up here, and because this genius thing is showing here, it almost makes it look like the top ones are ads instead of... Instead of what they are. And so I'm a little bit concerned about that. I'm gonna go ahead and click on the top one. It says it looks like it's twenty two hundred. I don't know the difference between the top two. I guess it's when it lands? They must just have different layovers. But I click see flight. It shows me the flight. Um... I don't understand any of this. It's still the cheapest, so I click select. Um... It has a bunch of stuff. Next, it wants contact details, so I'm done. You are? Close the... Okay, it's March 1st. So I'm doing it for a wifi breakfast jam, 4 plus rating, .250. Okay. This time I'm not gonna make the mistake. Marina Bay... Singapore. Again with the Marina Bay Sands. I really don't know what that is. Alright. First, tenth... Two adults again, back down to one. They really don't like single people. This study makes me feel lonely. You've hurt me psychologically. Um... Oh, a map just showed up on top of everything else. I kind of like this, but I kind of hate it because it has nothing to do with what I want. Um... Breakfast included. We had a limited amount of money, didn't we? Less than 250. Um... We said four or five stars. Again, this rating system is weird. Because I don't... I want four or five stars. Like, it's not like any five star hotel is gonna be cheaper than a four star hotel. It's like, I don't know. I don't know if five star hotel is gonna be cheaper than a four star hotel, but I'm still gonna do it. Um... I don't know the difference between fitness and fitness center. And I don't know why those things are considered fun. But somehow it's clicked spa for me. I don't know why. Um... I have breakfast, gym, four rating. I haven't had wifi yet. I also don't actually trust this stuff. I don't know if free wifi is different. But I don't... I would need to actually read about these things. Because if I was booking this and they didn't have this stuff, I'd be so mad. I don't know. Um... I'm looking for the nightly cost. But there is no nightly cost. So they're gonna make me do math again. Um... 250 times by 10. So this must be less than that amount. Um... I really... Oh, but that's not in Marina Bay, is it? This isn't even Singapore. What in the world? Okay, so there's no results again. I suspect because Marina Bay is a city. And Marina Bay is a fancy place. And there's no such thing as cheap hotels there. Um... This is dumb. I'm already annoyed by this. Let's increase the price filter. Yeah, that's what I was gonna do. I'm just scrolling through. Um... Still nothing. Oh, maybe something. Maybe there's just so much lag. We said 250... This one is... I'm gonna sort this by price. I'm gonna sort this by price. But this doesn't make any sense. Because, oh, there's like a three... Like a five second lag. These ones don't even have prices anymore. Oh my goodness. What is this? I'm ruining your eye tracking because I'm slouching. Um... I give up. I'm gonna click on this one. It says it's the cheapest, so it must be. I trust it. I don't even... It doesn't even... This is a totally different website. What happened? It doesn't even show a price. 2200 plus 425. Okay, that's close enough. So I'm gonna choose... This is 2200. Plus 425. It's more than... Yeah. Yeah. Um... But the problem is, it has 2 guests instead of 1, despite being cheaper. So I'm actually gonna pick this one. Oh, but breakfast isn't included. Interesting. So I'll pick this one. Because it fits your criteria better. If I click, I'll reserve. Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do. Do-do-do-do-do. Search for rent-a-car with pick up and drop off at Singapore airport. blah blah blah blah blah I'm not annoying you am I? I'm doing this correctly enough? yeah sure okay as long as you keep thinking up okay I've been doing my best um I picked our car rentals because now I've learned my lesson a couple times pick up location is gonna be Singapore Airport I still have no idea which one so I'm just gonna pick Changi it still doesn't memorize my dates which is annoying first to tenth it was weird how it like shifted March from right to left it really shouldn't have done that it's first to tenth the right date yes it is 2024 10 a.m. to 10 a.m. driver age 30 to 65 we're just gonna pretend for a second I'm 30 because I only saw that as I was already going and that's a weird time to use it used to be 25 and up so that is strange we said less than 250 they don't even have the prices 250 like it's this makes no sense that's okay that just means it's cheap I think I already clicked SUV no I didn't standard SUVs I need unlimited mileage and it says it's I could be a deal I think this is less than 150 no it's not oh and it's nine days not ten days I don't think that booking.com has a I don't have the option for one that is 150 per night unless I've made a mistake here at this airport and so I'm just gonna say that this is close enough and I'm just gonna click on continue to book because there are no options happy yeah okay mentally demand I thought that one was much more mentally demanding what wasn't more mental indemandment. It was less consistent. Also, that stupid map view killed me. What the hell? I asked for an explicit place. It just wouldn't do anything I wanted it to. How hurried. I'm creating temporal demand myself. Um, I guess I... I'm getting mentally tired, and so this one felt more rushed than the other one. Um, how successful? I think I had lower success than the last one. This felt worse. I had to give up more. I had to work quite hard. Just because so many things changed. I was annoyed. That was annoying. When it kept on changing things and swapping things out, ugh. I think that I would like to use this. No. No. I would not like to use this frequently. That was terrible. I feel like I've used Booking.com before, and it's not that bad. It wasn't necessarily complex. It gave me things, and then it took them away constantly. What do you mean by things? I'm taking away. Like the map view. Like it, like, like, it gave me... You liked it at first. No, I hated it. It was showing up on top as if it was some extra good thing, but it was never an extra good thing. It was just... It was just... It was visually too much. I liked it because it was... I like... When I'm booking a hotel, I want to know where it is, but I want to, like, represent that visually. I want to see which things... I, like... The problem is I'm doing, like, multi-parameter optimization when I'm booking something. Right? I care about location, I care about price, and I care about, like, some amenities. So I'll throw away everything that I don't want, right? I'd already picked a location, which means that I only care about that location. Don't show me anything else to some degree. Unless maybe there's an option to, like, be flexible, but I didn't care about that, and I didn't explicitly choose it, and so it was annoying. Um... So it was just complicated. It was not easy to use for those same reasons. I think that I would need the support of a technical person. I mean, I am a technical person, and so I am never going to say yes to this. I feel like it would be, like, this is an attack on me personally if I have to do that. Not the system. I found the various functions of the system were all well-integrated. No, because it, like, opened in different tabs and stuff like that. Like, it really didn't feel like I was in, like, one consistent experience. I thought there was too much inconsistency. Yes. Because of the different experiences thing. I would imagine that most people would learn to use the system very quickly. No. I don't think anybody learns how to use it. It was cumbersome for all the same reasons. I felt confident using a system. No, I have absolutely no idea if I made good choices. I needed to learn a lot about things before I could keep going with the system. No, I mean, it was approachable. It's just that none of the approaches made sense. Your turn. Okay. So first, let's talk about booking the flights. What were the easiest and most challenging parts of that task? I'm already forgetting. Um, the booking the flight felt pretty easy, I think. Um, I guess the most challenging was determining if there was actually an ad on top. Because of that genius thing in the middle, that's like a classic pattern of websites to show you, like, an advertisement at the top of the fold. And so... That's what you see when you search on Google. Yeah, exactly. And so I've been trained to, like, ignore the first thing kind of thing. And that, like, triggered my, like, classifier. What about the hotel search task? How did you find the process of filtering and choosing an option? Were there any features or information that you thought you were missing? Um, the map view just killed me. Like, it showed me the things that I didn't ask for. I explicitly filtered them out by giving the location. And then it lied to me and it told me that they were within my price range, but they weren't. Um, yeah. Um, what about the searching for a rental car? How successful were you? I didn't see one that was the correct price. I don't know why that is, either. Like, I'm not confident that it was because there actually weren't any available. Or maybe I'm just getting mentally tired and I'm unable to, like, make decisions. But, I guess the problem is, is that, like, I'm taking these instructions to be, like, you should be able to do this, right? Like, these are reasonable things. Like, if a friend told me... Weren't you able to find a car on the other website? I was. And so I feel like I must have done something wrong. Because I have some priors over, like, what I think a reasonable price should be. But I don't remember if I chose the same airport or not. So it could be that I was on a different airport. And it could also be... It could also just be that they have different deals available. Who knows? Were there any standout features or frustrations? Yeah. Okay, there you go. Um, the map view was pretty standout. Um, I still don't understand that. I don't know why it decided to show me... things that weren't... that weren't in my budget. That was dumb. I asked for something and it didn't give it to me. Um... Was that the question? Do you think it can be improved on? The map feature? Like, you can see where the hotels are. Wouldn't that be a positive aspect? Yes. I think that in an ideal map view, it's gonna show me at a glance the, like... Like, there's things... The reason I want to see a map is because I'm going to spend some time somewhere. So, for example, it really depends... Like, if I'm going to a city... Like, let's say I'm visiting New York and I'm trying to book a hotel. What I want to know is, like, the distance to, like, some key points or something like that. So, like, maybe the map view... Have you seen those maps where it's, like, a flood fill and it shows, like, how long it takes to get to a certain point by transit? So, like, it has, like... Everything is, like, green close to you and those are all the places that can be, like, gotten to 10 minutes by walking and then 20 minutes by walking and then 30 minutes by walking. Or something. They're really cool. And you could do something like that where you, like... I don't know. Just, like, skewing the perceptions of the map to show, like, how close a hotel is to things I care about. Or, at the very least, the simplest way of doing this is by putting a star on something I care about and then showing the physical location of the hotels around that and making sure the scale fits what I want it to. Don't show me things outside of those things. Like, I guess... Yeah, I don't know. I want something more integrated that knows more, I guess, right? I feel like you've already answered this question a little bit, but if there's anything you want to add. What improvements or additional features would you suggest for Booking.com based on your experience today? I think just making better use of the screen real estate for the map view. Like, the map took up, like, two-thirds of the available real estate, but it had the least information that's important to me. The only important thing it says is proximity, but that is the thing I care about the least. And so, I just would like to see screen real estate used more effectively. Okay. Next one. Okay. Do you want to take a break? We have one more. Um, I should be fine.\n",
      " It was Singapore. Press any key to continue. Press the escape key. Escape key? Going to Singapore, March 1st, 2024, March 10th, 2024. No more than one layover or travel time of 30 hours per trip. Okay? Okay. If you ever forget the instructions, they're here on the right. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay.

Okay. Maximum trip duration is here. What are you looking for? Well, I'm looking for at most 30 hours. So, I'm going to reset that. And since it's cheapest. Okay. So, this is at most 30 hours.

No, I don't want Singapore. I want Marina Bay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Marina Bay, Singapore. Okay. Let's go. And it's just for me. Great. Okay. Okay. So, 4 plus stars rating.

That way we get both of them in case it's not inclusive. In case it's literally just precisely 4 star ratings. All right. Wi-Fi. Yeah. So, let's go to amenities. And the first one is amenities. Okay. So, breakfast. Breakfast included. We're going to click. Then we've got gym available. Okay. So, I'm going to click. And then less than 250. Let's just do this first. Less than 250. All right. Just.

This one's free Wi-Fi. Okay. So, I'm going to un-click that because it doesn't specify. No. It says Wi-Fi included. So, yes. That would be free Wi-Fi. Okay. So, I'm going to click this. So, I'm going to click that. That's my website. Okay. So, that's my website. That's my website. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. gonna unclick five stars because you know we just need it to be four still nothing okay it's possible I've made a mistake or you know it just it doesn't show things so how about we relax the price filter okay sure we can relax the price filter so what we can do up to $500 whoa okay 300 yeah let's try that okay no results let's do 500 this is this is like with all these amenities man all these amenities okay and let's okay and let's okay and let's okay and let's just bring back five stars and we'll see if bring back five stars and we'll see if bring back five stars and we'll see if we can get something okay so we will sort by cheapest and okay so we will sort by cheapest and okay so we will sort by cheapest and that won't give us the one that actually that won't give us the one that actually that won't give us the one that actually exists what is the is there a short way exists what is the is there a short way exists what is the is there a short way too I'm ready're looking for I just something I'm ready're looking for I just something I'm ready're looking for I just something that helps me sort by the that helps me sort by the that helps me sort by the cheapest as I said before cheapest as I said before Okay, I'm gonna say... Okay, it only gives us four options, so I'm gonna choose this one, which is the cheapest one. And this one actually does look like it should be around, close to the price range, because there's a discount. So I'm not sure why that didn't come up. Interesting. And it has four stars. So, okay, so we'll click that one, and we will close the browser and click escape. Okay, search for realms of car with pick up and drop off at Singapore Chain Night. Okay. Sure. Car rentals... Didn't work oddly. Okay, pick up location is going to be Singapore Chain Night Airport. Great. And we're picking it up March 10th. Or March 1st to March 10th. Okay. Okay. Okay. And... Oh, you guys didn't specify the time, so I'm gonna choose whatever time. And we'll go for it. Okay. Okay, so unlimited mileage, be an SUV. Mileage unlimited, car category SUVs. And then price less than 150 CAD per day. So, okay, well, it looks like there's only one thing that exists, and it fits within our range, so found it. Great. Okay, let's close the browser, and we'll go for it. Okay, sure. Oh, do I just continue? I keep clicking escape? Yeah. Okay. Bye. Are the price lists okay? Mind the instrumental dove. Okay. Okay. No? Not really. Oh, my God. Okay. Okay. Bye... Okay. Okay. 1. 4. 6. 7. 12. Just wonderful to watch it fly with us. That's really cool. I was just gonna say... You know, it's kind of like looking back, I've just tried to look at this Paramount Phone app, and it sort of came off like... I probably would have taken more time to consider things. So as compared to how rushed I would be if I were actually selecting a hotel for myself, that would take much longer because I'd want to look at the details of the hotel, look at photos and stuff like that. But in terms of just like having a list of things that I need to check off, it's quite quick. So I'd say moderately rushed compared to what reality would be. But that's the assumption I'm making is how rushed it would be compared to reality. For going through a list, a checklist, I don't think it was rushed. But I'm assuming that you guys want it with comparison to how I'd actually be doing it in real life, if that makes any sense. How successful are you in accomplishing the tasks? I think I'm going to put high because I was able to find things that fit the criteria. I put the criteria for two of three. And I admit I could have done something wrong. So actually, maybe I'll put moderate here for success because there was one where I couldn't find stuff. But I don't know how much that has to do with me as it has to do with the fact that it just didn't exist. Or maybe I clicked something wrong. You can tell me at the end of the user set. How hard did you have to work? Remember, we're evaluating the website. We weren't evaluating you. Oh, okay, okay, okay. So then moderate. So how hard did you have to work to accomplish your level of performance? Very low. Low. There was some amount of work. Sometimes you couldn't see exactly where. Sometimes it was a little unclear as to where the different categories would be. I remember when I was looking through the hotels, I couldn't quite find the gym because it was kind of hidden in the menu. It was a drop-down, so I couldn't find that there. Are you recording, by the way? Yeah. Okay, cool. How irritated, stressed, or annoyed were you? Very low. I like to use this system frequently. Is that a system you would use normally? I never really used Booking.com. Okay. In fact, I haven't really booked too many hotels in my life, to be honest, so I can't really provide much. As a neutral, I mean, it was fine. Like, if I needed to go for a one-stop shop for everything, then sure. But I'm too cheap to go to a one-stop shop and to believe that that would be the best way of spending my money. So you're not convinced? I'm not convinced. You're putting that down to see the benefits. No, no, no. I've only looked at one source. I need to, you know, if I were really to use that system frequently, I'd need to be certain that it was giving me good deals. And from an initial inspection, I can't be certain because I need to compare elsewhere and, you know, do a whole bunch of things. I found the system unnecessarily complex. Strongly disagree. I don't think it was very complex. I thought the system was easy to use. Sure. I guess like there are times when it wasn't super easy. All right. Support of a technical person to be able to use the system. I strongly disagree. I don't think I really needed a lot of support on the system. Just because like, I don't know, I've used these sorts of services before. I haven't used booking.com in particular. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Java websites. Hmm? Java websites in general. I don't know about Java websites, but we're talking about this system. No, Java websites. Of travel. I thought you said Java. I was like, Java websites. It's like programming. It's confused. Yeah, travel websites, I've used them before. At the beginning, there was some confusion, but now I don't need, you know, help using them necessarily. I found the various functions in the system were well integrated. Another thing is the mechanics of the system. So let me just change it ask you a question about web maps Lazar? We can see... that when we go to a picture 없 if it's one invitation of a user saying either, um, you know, one person is face-to-face, so those are just the actions that popular geographic марkeers can utilize. If can, your options and you expect that this approach that you use to be consistent exactly um I mean at the end of the day it was all just checklists to determine things so I'd say I'm pretty neutral on this it didn't affect me much but I hadn't really noticed inconsistency okay I would imagine that most people would learn to use the system very quickly I'd say most young people would I would say that my grandmother for example would not or my mother would have a lot of trouble with the system so I don't know what the population statistics are these days and what the age ranges are so I'm gonna go neutral I think some people like me would have an easier time other people who maybe aren't as technologically adept would certainly struggle I found the system very cumbersome to use I'm gonna like slightly agree it was a little cumbersome at times I feel very confident using the system um okay confident about what how do you define confidence the way that I would define confident if I felt confident using the system to me that would mean that in some way that I trust this is the system that I'm in and I'm not going to be able to do anything about it the system to a certain degree but I mean I could also think of confident as being like well I feel confident that I am selecting the right things within the scope of the task if that's the case that I'm strongly confident if I'm so I think yeah this a guy would he used the liebe Enzo the quality of this in the quality of this but yeah what you want you wanted to talk about quality the system of this question we want us to concentrate on quality Russomus this question does not exist that is what you want you wanted to talk about quality this name of this question well see writing essentially that any kind of learning history involves asking similar questions and each person is in that you ever don't meet with my fear of one another teaching and that problems at the sit in person to book a travel website okay yeah if you were to think of booking some I don't know hotel or something yeah how confident would you be to choose this website okay do your that's not how I would have interpreted this question how confident I'd be I'd be quite neutral because I don't know much about this website and I need to compare it to other ones in order to be confident in that website okay before strongly I didn't know anything it was just like it was all stuff that I'd already learned before okay so we have three questions yeah am I using the eye tracking anymore at all or no it's not important okay once you pass the actual test you just filling out the questionnaire okay so you're just filling out the questionnaire and you're just going to go okay so first let's speak about booking the round-trip flights yeah what were the easiest and most challenging parts of that task the round-trip flights the most challenging part there's only one brief challenging part where I just assumed that it would be auto-loaded to the flights when I loaded the website but it was instead on the hotel so I was like okay I want to go to Singapore I guess it knows I'm in Toronto like maybe it has you know my location information but then I started to think about it and I started getting hotels my two steps I was like oh you know gotta reevaluate and then I found the proper tab for flights I think that was really the only challenging thing I think like challenging was like you know in the second task it seems that the second task was over specified to the point where nothing actually existed that fit the criteria I don't know yeah I'm booking the hotel for the second test are you just talking about the flights right now okay is that your next question yeah yeah so booking the hotel I wasn't able to actually find something that specified the exact criteria that we're looking for and maybe um because I think it was all already in CAD it could have been in another currency yeah but maybe that's why I didn't get anything but I think it was in CAD so that seemed is that something that you were looking for? is that something you would typically check for when you're booking what money yeah of course that's like the most important thing for me I'm assuming that most of the time you know one it knows I'm flying from Toronto two it probably I've already probably accepted location services on the website if I'm going to be buying something with them so I'd assume that they'd know that I'm buying CAD but it is something that I'd check especially but I'd usually I'd probably go to booking.ca if I was checking okay like I'd be going to the Canadian version of the website to ensure okay I didn't check you didn't immediately I didn't check what about the process of filtering and choosing an option yeah are there any features or information that you thought were missing features or information I thought was missing on the website any features on the website that I thought could have been there yeah could have been improved I think the drop-down menus were so much frustrating because sometimes you'd be scrolling for something for example in amenities I was looking for gym but the drop-down menu itself like one it wasn't really a drop-down menu in the sense that like a drop-down menu usually is it was like a part of a menu with a drop-down feature that would extend the menu yeah and I get that they want to keep things like compressed and they want to put the important stuff at the top but I had to figure out that that existed and then find that the gym was in the lower hidden portion of it yeah what about searching for rental car are there any aspects of the website that helped or hindered your search? it was all easy finding the rental car was simple is there anything that could make this your process more user-friendly? more user-friendly I'm not sure I mean I'm not sure I mean to be honest I don't think I don't think I necessarily need an SUV yeah so maybe if they saw that I only really been interested in you know single flights right or a hotel for one they could suggest me a smaller car I don't need to pack so much stuff into it but I don't I think that would also be making assumptions because some people want SUVs even if they're just driving a loan for safety reasons they feel like they want to be safer in a they'd be safer in a larger car I guess something that could be more helpful is like recommendations depending on destination I'm not sure if it's like this in Syria or other places that you've lived but in Italy for example streets are quite tight having a big car doesn't make a lot of sense right so if they had some information on your destination there could also be some suggestions as to you know what sort of car you might be interested in getting because of the destination itself so you expect this feature to be part of the website and not something that's a traveling person would look up before they book a car I don't expect the feature to be a part of the website I was answering your question as to how my experience could be confused yeah or it could improve yeah yeah okay last question are there any what was your overall impression and were there any standout features or significant frustration I wouldn't say there any significant frustrations these are things that I'm like a lot of the little things that went wrong were frustrations that occur on almost every website right and in fact a lot of the time with for example that I didn't realize that the tab was there right that the tab was switched that was annoying which sound like when I didn't realize that I was searching for hotels instead of a flight yeah that was annoying because I you know the first task was for the airport and I assume it was just like a travel booking site so I figured like the most important thing when you're booking a travel site would be you know how you're getting there with a flight right but that wasn't like a major inconvenience or a significant problem it took very little time to adjust to yeah are there any features that you liked features that I liked so there's a lot of text on the website and because I don't really like any of the features in particular I can't really name any specific feature because the website in itself is just built to get all of my specifications on like tied up right like tying up loose ends and I guess the reason why that's important in this sort of system is that when you're booking on a travel site people have exceptionally diverse needs right so there isn't a lot of room for making new features it feels that will because inherently if you make features that suggest things or like limit the complexity of the website in itself you limit the accessibility of some of the attributes that people would want to select right and if you if your website incorrectly assumes that somebody doesn't want to attribute it doesn't show it to them then they can't access it right so I guess the point that I'm making is there's no particular feature in particular that's going to be used to make the website accessible to people right so I guess the point that I'm making is there's no particular feature in particular that I'm looking for on the website and it just seems that the website lets you you know select things at a very high level a very low level of specification actually so you actually can add a lot of details if you want in your search and that seems necessary to me on a travel site to a certain degree because people have very diverse needs but yet no particular feature that I liked or disliked so it met your standards overall yeah I wasn't just like expectations yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah heart\n",
      " Where am I going? Oh great, they're already asking you to sign up for crap. Like that. Flights. Oh it knows my location. It's spying on me. Same dates. What is the point of this? Oh my. They made me wait with the cover icon and then there's still no results. That's nice. Okay, so what do I need? Cheapest with at most one layover. What the heck? There is no way to add layover stops. So this is definitely the worst of them. Oh no, there's one. I'm blind. Okay, I see it. One stop max. Why is it called stop? At most 30 hours. Wait, so each way has to be less than 30, right? Okay, so none of these will work. Because both are too long. Or one of them is too long. Uh-huh. Uh... Did I find one? I guess this is the cheapest I've seen so far. Maybe it's a promoted one. I don't know. 33, 31. Nope. Nope. Okay, this is annoying. What are you trying to do? Trying to match the hours. I'm just trying to make sure everything is under 30. And I only found one that was like 2,400 or something. Yeah, I don't think there's anything cheaper. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Uh... Oh, there is a travel time. Nice. Okay, I missed that. What did you miss? They had the duration filter. It just looks so weird. I didn't even pay attention to it. It's like they didn't put any effort into their UI. It's at the very bottom. Uh... Okay, so I found it. That's nice. I'm gonna go with this one. I'm gonna go with this one. It's going to India. Okay. Nice. Uh... Under 30 hours. One layover. Cool. I have to lock the... Yeah, standard ticket please. Cool. Should I close it? All done? Yeah, please. Okay. Hotel. Stays. Okay. Again, just like last time. I want to have it just use this information. I want to have it just use this information. Uh... Which information? The date. The location I already put. And the dates. When searching for the flights. Yeah, because it's already there. I guess I could have done both through this. Looking for flights button. But... Or... Yeah. Both of them. I guess I could have done both through this. That's fine. Okay. Four stars. Four stars. Okay, what am I looking for? Four stars. Gym available. Four stars. Gym available. Free cancellation? No. Breakfast included. I found that one. Breakfast included. I found that one. I need to find a location. I need to find a location. A specific place. Marina or something. Neighborhood? Is it a neighborhood? Is it a neighborhood? Oh no, it's not. Oh no, it's not. Or is it? Okay, it's not showing up. Which is ridiculous. I can't search by Marina or something. I can't search by Marina or something. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. Marina Bay. River. No, it's not a river. Yeah, it's not in here. Yeah, it's not in here. Okay. Have you considered typing your main search option to Marina Bay? Like manually typing it? I guess I could do that. That's annoying. I don't want to do that. Marina Bay. Okay, I could do that. I would prefer it. Just show me. Search. Search. Search. Breakfast included. Oh, it's gone. Because we searched again. Everything's gone. Everything being? All the filters. Like four stars, breakfast included. Everything's gone, so I have to reset it. And I still can't find the WiFi one. And I still can't find the WiFi one. But fitness center is there. Where's WiFi? Where's WiFi? It's in here somewhere. I guess it's I guess it's I guess it's probably included, but it doesn't show it anywhere. probably included, but it doesn't show it anywhere. Yeah, I hate this website. Yeah, I hate this website. Yeah, I hate this website. It doesn't have explicitly anything. Okay, we're just going to go with the first one because I don't see the other one. I don't see the other one. And my assumption is it's going to have WiFi. So let's go with that. Top picks? No. Lowest, please. Lowest, please. Lowest, please. Okay. 2098. So four stars. Okay, it's four star. And the reviews are terrible, but who cares. But who cares. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, okay. There is no WiFi. There is no WiFi. Or maybe there is, but I can't tell. Or maybe there is, but I can't tell. WiFi, WiFi. No, I don't see it. No, I don't see it. Yeah, it doesn't explicitly state it. Internet. Internet. Streaming services. Maybe there is WiFi. Oh, here it is. Okay, that's ridiculous. Foods, high speed internet. Okay, I'm done. Reserve. One room, please. Alright, nice. Okay. Same place. Same place. Same place. Same place. Same place. Same place. Same place. Wait. I'm doing cars. This time I just searched with stays. It's my bad. Car rentals. Wow, it's a different website. It looks so different. It looks so different. Again, Singapore. Airport, please. It seems like a very obvious feature that every company should have, but they don't. They already collect cookies. Why don't they just auto-fill everything? Okay, well, that's fine. Is this something you've experienced before? The auto-fill thing? Yeah. No, I just want it. I just want it. I just want it. I just want it. Because I'm lazy. Okay, so they do the same thing as Trip.com where it's at the top. What's at the top? The car types. But there's less car types here. And they don't tell you the prices of them here. So, that's different from Trip.com. So, that's different from Trip.com. Oh, this one has a day-to-day price. Nice. And there's only one car. What? How is this possible? We went through three websites. Two of them had like ten cars. Twenty cars. And this one has one. I mean, I guess I put airport. But still. That's crazy. But this task is much easier. But this task is much easier. Because there's only one car. If I... Wait, actually, no. It's not easier. Because it shows up. Well, no, actually, I don't know. It fits the criteria. That's all I know. So, I think it's right. It's an SUV. It has a little bit of mileage. And price is under the price I need. Cool. Wow. I don't want full protection. Go away. Okay, done. Okay. Cool. Questions. How demanding? This time it was a little bit more demanding. Because... What happened? The hotel was terrible. The hotel search was horrible. I never want to use this website ever again for any hotels. How physically demanding? Low, I guess. Hurried. Very low. How successful? I guess I was pretty successful. It just took longer from my side. How hard did you have to work? A little bit harder. I would say high. Because task two was annoying. How irritated? Moderate. Because task two was annoying. I would like to use this system frequently. No, never. Don't give me booking.com ever. Unnecessarily complex. Was it complex or just really badly laid out? I don't think it was complex. It was just very poorly laid out. How many people do you need? Do I need... No, I do not need anyone. How many people do you need? Very selected while integrated. I guess they're all equally bad. They're all integrated in a poor way. I guess they're all equally bad. Not really. I'll just go with that. Inconsistency. Between the three, right? Between the three tasks. The third one looked different. In the end, it's got the same left side and right side. So I guess it's not that inconsistent. So I guess it's not that inconsistent. It's just bad. It's just bad. Maybe they would. Maybe they would. Cumbersome. Yes, I agree. I hate this website. Real confident. I do not. Yeah, not really. Need to learn a lot of things. No. Not really. Okay. Okay, now I have some questions for you. Mm-hmm. Can you describe your experience in finding the round trip flight on booking.com? What were the easiest and most challenging parts of the task? What were the easiest and most challenging parts of the task? This is for across all three? No, just on booking.com. Okay, okay, booking.com. For now, we're just focusing on booking.com. Um... It was okay. It had the duration thing, but it was at the very bottom. So at first I was looking through it manually, and then I found it. And then I eventually saw that there was a filter at the very bottom. I don't know why they put it at the very bottom, because people care about duration. But for whatever reason, it's at the bottom. Um... Otherwise... Pricing part was okay. It gave me both... One thing I did like about this website, actually, for... I just realized, for the flight task, is it shows you both the two and round. Like both sides. Because with the other ones, you only select the two first, and then the front first, right? Or later. So then... You don't get to see the 3030 immediately. You have to click one, and then you have to go through the browser again to find it. But here it shows you this block. Like the departure and arrival. Or, sorry, coming back and going again. So that was nice. I guess. But... The task wasn't too hard with that website. So you prefer booking... Like when you're searching for flights, you prefer to find options for both? Yeah. Ideally, if it's available, that makes it easier. Because with the other ones, it gives you one price. But you know it's not the real price. Because as soon as you click the return, that's when the price changes, right? Because it first will show you, like, oh, 1800, or whatever. Then you click it. And then it shows you all the return, and then the first one is usually the worst one, because it's like 50 hours or something. So technically they're right. It's 1800 if you pick the worst flight. But you have to then go through it again. And then it tells you exactly what both are. What about the hotel search task? How do you define the process of filtering and choosing an option? Well, they don't even have locations. Is Marina Bay a neighborhood or a city? Because it should be a neighborhood. But it wasn't. And then you suggested searching on the search bar, and then I did it. When you were searching for hotels in Marina Bay on other websites, how was your experience? I think they both had the option, right? Yeah, they both had that option. So I didn't have to do anything. So this is definitely worse. Because I have to search for it manually, which is, why would I ever need to do such a thing? It should just show me all the neighborhoods. And I can click through them depending on where I want to stay. But maybe they treat neighborhoods differently from cities or something. I don't know what they're doing. Were there any other filters that you felt were missing? No. They had the Wi-Fi thing. Yeah, that was really annoying too. Because it's just like the first website, right? It doesn't show you the Wi-Fi options. And it's even worse because I went through it in so many places I couldn't find it. And eventually I saw it in the booking the hotel. That's when it shows high speed internet in green or something. That's when I discovered it. That's way too far. But also, at this point, if there's a hotel that doesn't have Wi-Fi, I'm never going to stay there. I don't have Wi-Fi anymore. So maybe that's okay if it doesn't exist because I take it for granted at this point. Like 10 years ago maybe. Or not even 10. 15 years ago maybe. What about searching for a rental car? How could that process be made more user-friendly? How could that process be made more user-friendly? How could that process be made more user-friendly? Well, in this task it felt really easy because there's only one car. So I didn't have to do anything. So I didn't have to do anything. I mean, I picked all the filters correctly. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? It's great. Well, if they're only in one car, I have to take it. If it meets my criteria, I'll take it. So that's fine. But I guess it's nice to see options if there's more than one car. But this one, for some reason, there was only one. But that part was okay. They had a price per day. They had unlimited mileage. They had a lot of car choices. So it's not that bad. Overall, Overall, what was your impression of this website? Overall, what was your impression of this website? It's okay. I wouldn't use it. But it has some decent options, I guess. But it has some decent options, I guess. The round trip, that part was nice. The round trip, that part was nice. Were there any standout features or significant frustrations? I guess it was standout, quote-unquote. Because I'm not that impressed, but at the same time, it has that to and from flight thing, which no one else has. So that's kind of cool. After seeing the other ones, I know it exists. So that's cool. But other than that, no. Frustrations-wise, yes. The neighborhood thing. That was frustrating. Because everyone else seems to have it. And they didn't. What improvements or additional features did you suggest for Booking.com? Based on your experience. Well, definitely add that filter back for neighborhoods. Or at least do a better job of that. Because it clearly doesn't work as well as it should. Otherwise, I think it's fine. There's nothing terribly wrong with it. I wouldn't really use it. Because I'm comfortable with Expedia. So I would just keep using it. Because it's not terrible enough for me to want to switch. But, yeah. I don't think there's anything terribly wrong with it.\n"

It looks so different.\").\\n\\n9. **Lack of Autofill for Repeated Information**:\\n   - The user expected the website to autofill information such as location and dates based on previous searches, which did not happen (\"They already collect cookies. Why don\\'t they just auto-fill everything?\").\\n\\n10. **Limited Options and Lack of Transparency in Pricing**:\\n    - For car rentals, the user found only one option available, which was surprising and made them question the website\\'s comprehensiveness.\\n\\n11. **General Frustration with the Website**:\\n    - The user expressed a strong dislike for the website due to the cumulative issues experienced during the tasks (\"Yeah, I hate this website.\").\\n\\nThese issues highlight problems with the website\\'s information architecture, user interface design, filter and search functionality, and consistency across different sections of the site.

I don\\'t know how this fits into the task... This feels like a scam.\").\\n   - Confusion over different prices displayed for the same hotel room (Transcript: \"I clicked reserve a room and nothing happened.

This was mentioned when the user was waiting for flight results.\\n\\n3. **Lack of a Duration Filter for Flights**:\\n   - The user was frustrated by the absence of a filter for total travel time (duration), which is critical for the task of finding flights under 30 hours. This was mentioned multiple times during the flight search task.\\n\\n4. **Inconvenient Filter Placement and Usability**:\\n   - The user found it inconvenient that the duration filter was not easily accessible and had to be used simultaneously with the price filter, forcing a choice between the two. This was discussed during the flight search task.\\n\\n5. **Difficulty in Identifying the Cheapest Flights**:\\n   - The user was confused by the sorting of flight options and had to manually search for the cheapest option under 30 hours, which was not immediately apparent. This was mentioned during the selection of the return flight.\\n\\n6. **Inconsistent Sorting of Flight Options**:\\n   - The user expected the cheapest flights to be listed at the end based on their experience with Canadian airlines, but found the opposite on Expedia, leading to a mismatch in expectations.

       "'3. Trip.com: Based on the think-aloud analyses from three participants, several significant usability issues with Trip.com have been identified. These issues are summarized below, with references to specific points in the think-aloud transcripts where they were mentioned or inferred:\\n\\n1. **Confusing Date Selection and Calendar Behavior**:\\n   - Participants experienced frustration with the calendar interface, which sometimes moved dates around unexpectedly, leading to potential booking errors (Participant 1: \"See it did that thing again where it moved it over.\").\\n\\n2. **Difficulty in Applying and Understanding Filters**:\\n   - Users struggled with applying filters for flight duration, layovers, and hotel amenities. They also found it difficult to understand the impact of these filters on search results (Participant 1: \"It summed up to more time than I expected it to. And it didn\\'t respect my prior filters in the multi-step process.\").\\n\\n3. **Inconsistent UI Components and System Behavior**:\\n   - There were inconsistencies in UI components and system behavior, particularly in how date selection was handled across different booking types (Participant 1: \"The last one moves the calendar over when you click one of the things. So I clicked one of them, but this one doesn\\'t.\").\\n\\n4. **Confusing Terminology and Labels**:\\n   - Users were confused by the terminology used for hotel amenities and car rental categories, which did not match their expectations (Participant 1: \"This difference in the way I communicate and it communicates with fitness room versus gym is really confusing.\").\\n\\n5. **Visual Clutter and Information Overload**:\\n   - The amount of information presented was overwhelming for users, making it difficult to track changes between screens (Participant 1: \"There\\'s so much information in front of me... I don\\'t know what I just did.\").\\n\\n6. **Unexpected System Behavior and Lack of Feedback**:\\n   - Users encountered unexpected system behavior, such as filters resetting without notice, and a lack of feedback when system states changed (Participant 3: \"I had already set the mileage filter. And then I switched from all models to SUV. And then it reset. But it didn\\'t tell me it reset.\").\\n\\n7. **Issues with Search Results and Navigation**:\\n   - Participants faced issues with search results refreshing and scrolling back to the top after applying filters, which disrupted the search process (Participant 2: \"The user was frustrated by the search results page automatically refreshing and scrolling back to the top after each filter application, disrupting the search process.\").\\n\\n8. **Inflexible and Imprecise Filter Options**:\\n   - Users found filter options to be inflexible and imprecise, such as the inability to set specific price limits for rental cars or fine-tune the flight duration filter (Participant 2: \"The user was annoyed that they could not set the price filter for rental cars to be specifically less than $150 per day.\").\\n\\n9. **Lack of Confidence in Booking**:\\n   - Due to the system not respecting user filters and other issues, users did not feel confident that they had booked the best option (Participant 1: \"I wasn\\'t confident in that because it erased my prior filter.\").\\n\\n10. **Intrusive Advertisements**:\\n    - Users were distracted and displeased by intrusive advertisements during their search process (Participant 3: \"I don\\'t like this ad.\").\\n\\nAddressing these issues would involve improving the clarity, consistency, and predictability of the interface, enhancing filter functionality and feedback, reducing visual clutter, and ensuring that the system behavior aligns with user expectations. These improvements would likely lead to a more intuitive and satisfying user experience on Trip.com.\\n'"

      "\n",
      "### Participant 1:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Patterns of User Behavior:\n",
      "1. Participant starts by searching for accommodations before flights, which is a common behavior as users often secure their stay first.\n",
      "2. The participant uses the search input to change the destination to \"Singapore, Singapore\" and sets the check-in and check-out dates.\n",
      "3. The participant navigates to the flights section after searching for accommodations, indicating a sequential approach to planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Deviations Indicating Usability Issues:\n",
      "1. The participant seems to reload the page after setting the initial search parameters, which could indicate confusion or a lack of feedback from the website that the search was successful or in progress.\n",
      "2. Rapid succession of clicks detected on various elements such as dates, buttons, and price listings, which could indicate frustration or confusion, possibly due to slow response times or unclear navigation cues.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Areas of Confusion or Trouble Spots:\n",
      "1. The participant clicked on the \"Singapore Changi Airport\" option multiple times, which could suggest that the selection was not clearly registered or there was no visual confirmation of the selection.\n",
      "2. The user was inactive for 16 seconds before selecting a rental car, which might indicate hesitation or difficulty in finding the desired option.\n",
      "3. The participant clicked on the price options repeatedly, which could indicate that the price was not updating or the user was unsure if the click had been registered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Participant 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Patterns of User Behavior:\n",
      "1. The participant directly uses the search results URL, which suggests they might have bookmarked it or navigated from a previous session.\n",
      "2. The user attempts to sign in, possibly to access personalized options or discounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Deviations Indicating Usability Issues:\n",
      "1. The participant seems to struggle with the flight search, as indicated by the repeated hovering and clicking without a clear outcome.\n",
      "2. The user returns to the homepage multiple times, which could suggest difficulty in navigating the site or performing the desired actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Areas of Confusion or Trouble Spots:\n",
      "1. The participant's interaction with the \"Car rentals\" section is limited, with hovering but no clear action taken, which could indicate uncertainty about how to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Participant 3:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Patterns of User Behavior:\n",
      "1. The participant starts with flight search, which is a logical first step for trip planning.\n",
      "2. The user attempts to filter hotel search results by various amenities and ratings, indicating a clear set of preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Deviations Indicating Usability Issues:\n",
      "1. Rapid scrolling and repeated clicks on the \"Search\" button suggest difficulty in finding the desired results or a lack of feedback from the site.\n",
      "2. The user modifies the search parameters multiple times, which could indicate that the filtering options were not clear or did not work as expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Areas of Confusion or Trouble Spots:\n",
      "1. The participant encounters \"0 results found\" multiple times, which could be due to overly restrictive filters or a lack of available options. This could lead to frustration and the need for clearer guidance on adjusting search criteria.\n",
      "2. The user's interaction with the car rental section shows rapid succession of clicks and hovering, which could indicate confusion about the selection process or pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Observations Across Participants:\n",
      "- Users often return to the homepage or reload pages, which could indicate navigation issues or a lack of clear feedback from the website.\n",
      "- Rapid clicks and scrolling are common across participants, suggesting potential frustration or confusion with the site's response times or layout.\n",
      "- There is a pattern of users attempting to sign in, which could be due to the promise of discounts or a more personalized experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Improvement:\n",
      "- Ensure clear visual feedback is provided after each user action, such as a loading indicator or confirmation message.\n",
      "- Improve the responsiveness of the website to prevent frustration from slow loading times or unregistered clicks.\n",
      "- Simplify the navigation flow to reduce the need for users to return to the homepage to complete tasks.\n",
      "- Provide guidance or suggestions when search results are zero or filters are too restrictive.\n",
      "- Enhance the clarity of the car rental process, possibly with a step-by-step guide or clearer pricing information.\n",

      "1. **Patterns of User Behavior:**\n",
      "   - Participant 3 seems to be exploring different sections of the site, including flights, hotels, and cars.\n",
      "   - They use filters to adjust their search criteria.\n",
      "   - They also prioritize price, as indicated by sorting options and input changes related to cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Deviations Indicating Usability Issues:**\n",
      "   - Rapid scrolling detected, which could indicate difficulty in finding the desired options or a lack of understanding of the interface.\n",

      "3. **Potential Confusion or Trouble Spots:**\n",
      "   - The user hovered over the \"Pick-up\" section multiple times without taking action, which could suggest confusion about the car rental process.\n",
      "   - The user was inactive for 21 seconds after sorting the hotel options by price, which might indicate they were unsure about the next steps or were evaluating their options.\n",
      "   - The user clicked on \"Reserve\" for a car rental but then hovered over many elements without further action, which could indicate confusion about the reservation process or second thoughts about the selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the logs suggest that users may experience confusion with price changes, difficulty in finding options within their budget, and uncertainty about how to proceed with bookings. Additionally, rapid scrolling and repeated hovering over the same elements without action could indicate a lack of clarity in the interface or frustration with the search process. These insights could be used to improve the usability of Expedia's website by providing clearer information, more intuitive navigation, and a more streamlined booking process.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n",
      "- Review the tasks given to the participants to understand the context of the user study.\n",
      "- Familiarize with the metrics and what they indicate about user behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Review Quantitative Metrics\n",
      "- Analyze the time to first fixation, fixation duration, number of fixations, saccade to fixation ratio, number of saccades, saccade amplitude, scan path length, spatial density of scan path, total fixation time, ratio of eye path to task length, and mean pupil size.\n",
      "- Compare these metrics across the three websites to identify which site had more usability issues based on these metrics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Analyze Qualitative Think-Aloud Data\n",
      "- Examine the insights from the think-aloud data for each website.\n",
      "- Identify common themes and specific usability issues mentioned by participants.\n",
      "- Correlate these issues with the quantitative metrics when possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Examine Browser Logs\n",
      "- Look at the patterns of user behavior, deviations, and potential trouble spots from the browser logs.\n",
      "- Determine if these patterns align with the issues identified in the think-aloud data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Synthesize Findings\n",
      "- Integrate insights from the quantitative metrics, think-aloud data, and browser logs.\n",
      "- Highlight the most critical usability issues for each website.\n",
      "- Suggest potential improvements based on the findings.\n",

      "- Provide actionable recommendations for each website to address the identified usability issues.\n",
      "- Prioritize recommendations based on the severity and frequency of the issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Reporting\n",
      "- Prepare a comprehensive report that summarizes the findings and recommendations.\n",
      "- Ensure the report is clear, concise, and actionable for stakeholders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's carry out the plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Review Quantitative Metrics\n",
      "- **Booking.com** has the highest time to first fixation, suggesting that users took longer to engage with the content. The total fixation time is also the highest, indicating that users spent more time looking at elements on the page, which could be due to difficulty in finding information.\n",
      "- **Expedia.com** has a higher saccade to fixation ratio, which might suggest users were scanning the page more than focusing on specific elements, possibly due to unclear content or layout.\n",
      "- **Trip.com** has the longest scan path length, which could indicate that users had to look around more to find what they needed, suggesting a less efficient layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Analyze Qualitative Think-Aloud Data\n",
      "- **Booking.com** issues include pop-up interruptions, confusing navigation, default settings not matching user needs, difficulty identifying the cheapest options, and filtering issues.\n",
      "- **Expedia.com** users faced confusing navigation and terminology, filtering challenges, inconsistent pricing, technical issues, and a lack of clarity in task requirements.\n",
      "- **Trip.com** participants struggled with date selection, applying filters, inconsistent UI components, confusing terminology, and visual clutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Examine Browser Logs\n",
      "- **Booking.com** logs show patterns of returning to the homepage and rapid clicks, indicating potential navigation issues and frustration.\n",
      "- **Expedia.com** logs suggest confusion with price changes and difficulty finding options within a budget.\n",
      "- **Trip.com** logs indicate frustration with the date picker and confusion over filtering options.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Synthesize Findings\n",
      "- **Booking.com**'s high fixation times and initial engagement delay correlate with reported pop-up interruptions and confusing navigation.\n",
      "- **Expedia.com**'s higher saccade to fixation ratio aligns with users' confusion over navigation and terminology.\n",
      "- **Trip.com**'s long scan path length matches participants' frustration with date selection and filter application.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Recommendations\n",
      "- For **Booking.com**, streamline pop-up use, improve navigation clarity, and ensure filters and settings are preserved between searches.\n",
      "- For **Expedia.com**, clarify terminology, improve filter functionality, and ensure pricing is transparent and consistent.\n",
      "- For **Trip.com**, enhance the date picker interface, provide clear feedback on filter application, and reduce visual clutter.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Reporting\n",
      "- Compile the findings and recommendations into a report, ensuring that the data is presented in a way that is understandable and actionable for website designers and developers.\n",

      "### Step 3: Analyze Qualitative Think-Aloud Data\n",
      "\n",
      "**Booking.com:**\n",
      "- **Pop-up Interruptions:** Correlates with the longer time to first fixation, as users were likely distracted by these elements before they could focus on their tasks.\n",
      "- **Confusing Navigation:** Supported by the high total fixation time and lower spatial density, indicating that users were searching for navigation elements or information.\n",
      "- **Filtering and Sorting Issues:** These could contribute to the longer scan path lengths, as users had to repeatedly search for and apply filters.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expedia.com:**\n",
      "- **Confusing Navigation and Terminology:** This aligns with the higher saccade to fixation ratio, as users may have been scanning the page for familiar terms or clear navigation cues.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Trip.com:**\n",
      "- **Confusing Date Selection and Calendar Behavior:** This is likely related to the longer scan path length, as users navigated back and forth to correct dates or understand the calendar interface.\n",

      "- **Repeated clicking on \"Heads up!\" notifications:** Indicates confusion or frustration with price updates, aligning with the think-aloud data about inconsistent and misleading pricing.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Trip.com:**\n",
      "- **Rapid succession of clicks on the date picker:** Suggests difficulty in interacting with the calendar, supporting the think-aloud data about confusing date selection.\n",

      "- Improve the clarity and functionality of filters, providing better feedback when applied.\n",
      "- Reduce visual clutter and ensure consistent UI components across the site.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 7: Reporting\n",
      "\n",
      "The final step would be to compile these findings and recommendations into a detailed report.

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis followed a structured approach, examining time to first fixation, fixation duration, number of fixations, saccade to fixation ratio, number of saccades, saccade amplitude, scan path length, spatial density of scan path, total fixation time, ratio of eye path to task length, and mean pupil size. Qualitative data from think-aloud protocols and browser logs were also reviewed to contextualize the quantitative findings.\n",
