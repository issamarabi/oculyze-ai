      " Okay, so I'm going to look for New York for the dates on 1st of November until the 30th November. It's just one traveler and yeah, I chose I accidentally searched for hotels instead of searching for flights. So I'm just going to go back even from Toronto going to New York. Same dates, 1st of October, 1th of November. So New York and the cheapest option is already sorted by price. The cheapest one is over $299. I said it's twice the other conditions which are less than $12 hour time and it has zero layovers. I'm perfectly turned flight the cheapest option also satisfies the conditions. Easy easy. Next I'm going to go. Now I'm going to search for hotels. Going to New York. I'm going to search for the first 30th one traveler. Search. Oh, I'm happy to make a free box for the appointment. I'm going to change that. The location setting. The hotel should have a breakfast included. Free Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi included. I second to filter it. We rated at least four stars. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. It is. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. Okay, double tree by hilton. Match was all looked criteria. And there it is. Okay, perfect. Next, let's do car rental. So hand, again. Cars, pick up. Pick up and drop off at GFK Airport. Pass and four same dates on the first third year. Good time, 1038m, good time. 1030m. Strict. Don't have any discount codes. Let's get that. Wow, it's taking some time to load. Looking for standards to see then. We might find a photo for that. Rental price should not exceed $50 per day. $50 per day, that's like $1500 for the whole trip. Okay, I found this great deal. On the Chevrolet Bolt or similar. Want to click reserve.

Okay, I'm looking for the cheapest option. That does not have more than one link over or travel time in 12 hours. That would be portrait headlines from Toronto to take $3. Yeah, that sounds good. Yeah, I thought those were these. Next, let's look for stays. For the same period. Okay, this is really appropriate to Expedia, a previous upside. Kayaks is awesome. They easy to use. For example, for Expedia, when I searched for hotels, first I searched for flights and then I had to search for hotels. I had to start searching from scratch again, whereas when I was searching for hotels, I searched for flights from Kayaks. The dates were all to preset and the destination. I didn't have to select New York again. The dates came up from the first and the one that I did. That's what was really easy. Okay, so let's filter in for free internet and free breakfast at the hotel. Price is not exceed $200 per night. So, I'm going to go to the hotel and find out what I'm doing. Awesome. Yeah, the hotel I found here, as well as the flight tickets on both of them were cheaper than on Expedia. Which is interesting. So, there's definitely a large variety here. Great. That's next. Look for car rental. Yeah, I'm really easy. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Want to pick it up and drop it off as JFK. I forgot to say that word search for the car. Okay. Okay, I found the car easily and it's about the same price of the car's own Expedia. Although this one's fully electric, so maybe it's an advantage possible. Oh, that's so funny. This car, I'm going to have to admit to Expedia. So, interesting. So, yeah, I just ended up printing the same car. Actually. Awesome.\n"
