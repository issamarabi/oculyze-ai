      " Okay, so I'm going to look for New York for the dates on 1st of November until the 30th November. It's just one traveler and yeah, I chose I accidentally searched for hotels instead of searching for flights. So I'm just going to go back even from Toronto going to New York. Same dates, 1st of October, 1th of November. So New York and the cheapest option is already sorted by price. The cheapest one is over $299. I said it's twice the other conditions which are less than $12 hour time and it has zero layovers. I'm perfectly turned flight the cheapest option also satisfies the conditions. Easy easy. Next I'm going to go. Now I'm going to search for hotels. Going to New York. I'm going to search for the first 30th one traveler. Search. Oh, I'm happy to make a free box for the appointment. I'm going to change that. The location setting. The hotel should have a breakfast included. Free Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi included. I second to filter it. We rated at least four stars. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I'm going to choose the first one. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. I second to filter it. Double-tree One turn. This regard is all in criteria. Now, Еще Thursday, perfect. Next, let's do car rental. So, I am again. Cars, pickup. Pick up and drop off at GFK Airport. Awesome. For the same dates on the first third year. Good time. 10.38 am. Good time. 10.30 pm. Stretch. I don't have any discount codes. Let's get that. Oh, it's taking some time to load. And again. Looking for standards to see then. We might find the filter for that. Rental price should not exceed $50 per day. $50 per day, that's like $1500 for the whole trip. Oh. Okay. I found this great deal. I'm going to go to the next one. On the Chevrolet Bolt or similar. I'm going to click reserve. Okay. Here we go. Perfect. All done.\n",
      " Next, I'm going to search for lights from Toronto to New York. Okay, so Toronto and New York. Setting the dates from the first to 30th. With the township. This part is annoying. Oh, okay, I'm looking for the cheapest option. That does not have more than one link over. Or travel time is in 12 hours. That would be portrait airlines with $230. Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, that was really easy. Next, let's look for stays. For the same period. Okay, this is really appropriate to Expedia, a previous upside. Kayaks are often easy to use. For example, for Expedia, when I searched for hotels, first one is search for flights. Then I had to search for hotels. I had to start searching for scratch again, whereas searching for hotels and searching for flights. Kayaks. The dates were all pretty set and the destination. So I didn't have to select New York again. The dates came up in the first and the 30th. That's what was really easy. Okay, so let's filter in. For free internet and free breakfast at the hotel. Price is not exceed $200 per night. The hotel is located in the middle of the night. The hotel is located in the middle of the night. The hotel is located in the middle of the night. Yeah, the hotel I found here as well as the flight tickets. Both of them look cheaper than on Expedia. Which is interesting. So, this is definitely a large variety here. Great, let's next look for car rental. I'm really easy. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Want to pick it up and drop it off as. I forgot to say that for the search for the car. Um. Okay, I found the car. Easily and it's about the same price of the car's own Expedia. Although this one's fully electric, so maybe that's an advantage possible. So, I'm going to go back to the next Expedia. Interesting. So, yeah, I've decided to protect the same car. Actually. Awesome.\n",

The `updateWebsiteAndTaskInputs` function is responsible for dynamically creating inputs for website names and task descriptions, while the `updateParticipantInputs` function creates the file upload fields for each participant.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that website names and task descriptions are only entered once and are not repeated for each participant, while still allowing for participant-specific file uploads.'"
