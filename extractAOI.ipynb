    "                        To compare the metrics across tasks and websites, we will look at the differences in the values for each metric for each task on each website. Here's a summary of the comparison:\\n\\n1. **Mental Demand**: The mental demand was generally low for all tasks on both websites, with a score of 2 or 1. This suggests that the tasks were not mentally taxing for the user.\\n\\n2. **Physical Demand**: The physical demand was also low for all tasks on both websites, with a score of 1. This suggests that the tasks did not require a lot of physical effort from the user.\\n\\n3. **Perceived Task Pace**: The perceived task pace was low for all tasks on both websites, with a score of 2 or 1. This suggests that the user did not feel rushed while completing the tasks.\\n\\n4. **Task Success Perception**: The user felt they were successful in completing all tasks on Expedia, with a score of 5 or 1. However, on Kayak, the user felt they failed Task 2, with a score of 7, and were moderately successful in Task 3, with a score of 4.\\n\\n5. **Effort Level to Achieve Performance**: The effort level was generally low for all tasks on both websites, with a score of 2 or 1. However, the user felt they had to put in a moderate amount of effort to perform well in Task 3 on Kayak, with a score of 5.\\n\\n6. **Emotional Stress Level**: The user experienced some stress while completing the tasks on Expedia, with a score of 4 or 2. On Kayak, the user experienced moderate stress in Task 3, with a score of 6, and some stress in Task 2, with a score of 4.\\n\\n7. **Number of Fixations Overall**: The number of fixations was highest for Task 1 on both websites, suggesting that the user had to search extensively to find the information they needed for this task.\\n\\n8. **Saccade to Fixation Ratio**: The saccade to fixation ratio was highest for Task 3 on both websites, suggesting that the user was scanning the screen quickly for this task.\\n\\n9. **Number of Saccades**: The number of saccades was highest for Task 1 on Expedia and Task 3 on Kayak, suggesting that the user was scanning the screen extensively for these tasks.\\n\\n10. **Task Completion Time**: The task completion time was longest for Task 1 on both websites, suggesting that this task was the most complex or difficult.\\n\\n11. **Time Until First Click**: The time until the first click was longest for Task 1 on both websites, suggesting that the user had difficulty figuring out where to start for this task.\\n\\n12. **Mean Time Between Clicks**: The mean time between clicks was longest for Task 2 on both websites, suggesting that the user had difficulty figuring out what to do next for this task.\\n\\n13. **Number of Mouse Clicks**: The number of mouse clicks was highest for Task 1 on Expedia and Task 3 on Kayak, suggesting that the user had to interact extensively with the website for these tasks.\\n\\n14. **Scanpath Length**: The scanpath length was longest for Task 1 on both websites, suggesting that the user had to search extensively to find the information they needed for this task.\\n\\n15. **Mousepath Length**: The mousepath length was longest for Task 1 on Expedia and Task 3 on Kayak, suggesting that the user had to move the mouse extensively for these tasks.\\n\\nBased on this comparison, it appears that Task 1 was the most challenging on both websites, as it had the highest values for several metrics. Task 2 on Kayak also seems to have been difficult for the user, as indicated by the high task success perception score and the long mean time between clicks.\\n\\nNext, let's move on to step 3 and identify potential usability issues based on these metrics.\\nBased on the metrics, we can identify several potential usability issues:\\n\\n1. **Task 1 Complexity**: Task 1, which involved searching for a round-trip flight, appears to have been the most complex or difficult task on both websites. This is indicated by the high number of fixations, saccades, mouse clicks, and the long task completion time, time until first click, scanpath length, and mousepath length. This suggests that the user had to search extensively and interact a lot with the website to complete this task. The flight search functionality on both websites might be complex or not intuitive enough, making it difficult for users to find the information they need.\\n\\n2. **Task 2 Difficulty on Kayak**: The user perceived that they failed Task 2 on Kayak, which involved searching for a hotel. This is also indicated by the long mean time between clicks, suggesting that the user had difficulty figuring out what to do next. The hotel search functionality on Kayak might be confusing or not user-friendly, making it difficult for users to complete the task.\\n\\n3. **Task 3 Stress on Kayak**: The user experienced a high level of stress while completing Task 3 on Kayak, which involved searching for a rental car. This is also indicated by the high number of saccades and mouse clicks, and the long mousepath length, suggesting that the user had to scan the screen extensively and interact a lot with the website. The car rental search functionality on Kayak might be stressful or frustrating for users, possibly due to a complex or confusing interface.\\n\\nNext, let's move on to step 4 and generate actionable insights based on these identified usability issues.\n",
    "                        \n",
    "                        Actionable insights:  1. Simplify Flight Search Functionality: Both Expedia and Kayak could improve the user experience by simplifying the flight search functionality. This could involve making the search filters more intuitive, improving the visibility of important information, or reducing the number of steps required to complete a search. This could help reduce the number of fixations, saccades, mouse clicks, and the task completion time, making the task less complex and more efficient for users.  2. Improve Hotel Search Functionality on Kayak: Kayak could improve the user experience by making the hotel search functionality more user-friendly. This could involve improving the clarity of the search filters, making the search results easier to navigate, or providing clearer instructions or prompts to guide the user through the task. This could help reduce the mean time between clicks, making the task less confusing and more straightforward for users.  3. Reduce Stress in Car Rental Search on Kayak: Kayak could improve the user experience by making the car rental search functionality less stressful. This could involve simplifying the interface, making the search filters more intuitive, or providing clearer instructions or prompts to guide the user through the task. This could help reduce the number of saccades and mouse clicks, and the mousepath length, making the task less frustrating and more enjoyable for users.  Finally, let's move on to step 5 and use the AI functions to analyze the accessibility trees of the webpages accessed during the tasks. This will give us additional insights into the structure and accessibility of the webpages, which can further inform our recommendations.   We will use the following functions for this analysis:  - `functions.expedia_task_1` - `functions.expedia_task_2` - `functions.expedia_task_3` - `functions.kayak_task_1` - `functions.kayak_task_2` - `functions.kayak_task_3`  By analyzing the accessibility trees, we can gain insights into how the information is structured on the webpages and how easy it is for users to access and understand this information. This can help us identify any potential issues with the webpage design or layout that might be contributing to the usability issues identified in the user study.\n",

Yeah, I thought those were these. Next, let's look for stays. For the same period. Okay, this is really appropriate to Expedia, a previous upside. Kayaks is awesome. They easy to use. For example, for Expedia, when I searched for hotels, first I searched for flights and then I had to search for hotels. I had to start searching from scratch again, whereas when I was searching for hotels, I searched for flights from Kayaks. The dates were all to preset and the destination. I didn't have to select New York again. The dates came up from the first and the one that I did. That's what was really easy.

Yeah, the hotel I found here, as well as the flight tickets on both of them were cheaper than on Expedia. Which is interesting. So, there's definitely a large variety here. Great. That's next. Look for car rental. Yeah, I'm really easy. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Want to pick it up and drop it off as JFK. I forgot to say that word search for the car. Okay. Okay, I found the car easily and it's about the same price of the car's own Expedia. Although this one's fully electric, so maybe it's an advantage possible. Oh, that's so funny. This car, I'm going to have to admit to Expedia. So, interesting. So, yeah, I just ended up printing the same car. Actually. Awesome.\n"
